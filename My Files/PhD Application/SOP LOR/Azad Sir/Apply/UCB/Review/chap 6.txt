ABCD-NL works well for accurately Booleanizing a large class of genuinely non-linear analog and mixed-signal systems. As with DAE2FSM and ABCD-L, the Boolean models produced by ABCD-NL can be used for high-speed simulation and formal verification. 

ABCD-NL takes a SPICE netlist as input, and it produces as output a purely Boolean model (an FSM)

each discretized combination of the circuitâ€™s inputs is associated with a DC state in the FSM
