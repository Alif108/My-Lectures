AMS design -- ( modelling, analysis, simulation, verification, testing, and debugging of AMS designs)


Gaps 
system wide simulation, ? 
hieararchical system modelling ?
major challenges and bottleneck in chip design
	-- AMS debugging 
	-- AMS testing

other representation except FSM, boolean models -> Language?

--- RNNs 
--- PDAs or Turing Machines ??

--- Modeling parasitic components (only in board level design)

--- modelling and analysis 
accuracy vs. amenability to analyze
accuracy vs. speed

--- In particular, read through ABCD-NL (Chapter 6), together with relevant previous background needed (eg, differential equation models and their simulation - use the attached monograph as necessary)
--- Try to make your own coherent mental picture of it, noting any gaps or questions that are not resolved yet.
--- Explain this mental picture in a short write-up (not much more than 2-3 pages), written in latex (using vim on linux).
--- It would be good if you would send me the write-up (including the latex source) in about a week from now (but let me know if you need more time).
