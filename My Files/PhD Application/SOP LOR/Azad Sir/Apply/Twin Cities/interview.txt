1. Your research experience and interest in robotics/learning/AI/perception.
2. Why grad school -- career plans? What after grad school? Why a PhD and not just an MS?
3. Your expectations from pursuing robotics research, and from the research group you want to be a part of (mine in this case).
4. My (group's) research goals and directions -- past, present and future;
5. My expectations of a grad student working with me, and my responsibilities for them.
