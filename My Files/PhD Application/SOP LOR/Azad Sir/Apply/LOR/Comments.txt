CSE 316
He encourages students very much and can teach flexibly.

 I cannot stress it enough how hard Azad sir worked for this course. He (probably) single-handedly wrote every lab sheet, did the experiments by himself before assigning it to students, gave us necessary links and documents before the lab. While doing the lab project, he spent hours after hours debugging our project for us! He was always available to help us, and did everything in his power to help us. He is very enthusiastic and passionate about teaching, and I hope we will get more of his courses on the future. He could be a role model for every student who would want to become a teacher.
