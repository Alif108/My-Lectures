I am particularly interested to work with Prof. Vicente Ordóñez Román. His  works in the intersection of vision and NLP is very intriguing and mathces with my interest. Prof. Hongning Wang's works on Machine Learning and Information Retrieval is equally interesting. Particualry his research on Joint Analysis of Text and Behavior Data (e.g., search logs, forum discussions, and reviews) is intriguing. I am also interested to work with Prof. Madhur Behl. My background in ML, optimization, and microcontroller based systems matches his line of research.
